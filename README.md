  * Rating Trends: By visualizing the relationship between developer responses and average ratings, the analysis underscores the importance of developer interaction in maintaining high app ratings.*

### Project 5: SQL
- **Date:* 03/28/2024*  

- **Role:* In my role at Zuber, I analyze data to uncover patterns that reveal passenger preferences and the impact of external factors, such as weather, on rides. By examining data from competitors and testing hypotheses, I aim to understand how weather influences ride frequency, providing insights that can guide strategic decisions as the company launch in Chicago. *  

- **Tools:* Ms SQL Server *  

- **Summary:* In this SQL project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of taxi ride data for specific time periods and conditions. I examined the number of rides for various taxi companies, focusing on specific dates and conditions such as company names containing "Yellow" or "Blue," and weather conditions. The analysis also included identifying key neighborhoods (Loop and O'Hare) and analyzing the impact of weather conditions on ride durations for trips between these locations. *

- **Impact:
  * Company Performance: The analysis identified Flash Cab as the top-performing taxi company during the specified period, followed by Taxi Affiliation Services. This insight can help Zuber understand the competitive landscape and prioritize partnerships or marketing efforts.
  * Brand Recognition: Companies with "Yellow" or "Blue" in their names had a significant number of rides, indicating strong brand recognition and customer preference.
  * Weather Impact: By classifying weather conditions as "Good" or "Bad," I determined that adverse weather conditions such as rain or storms influence ride durations, especially for trips from the Loop to O'Hare. This information can be crucial for optimizing ride pricing and service availability.*
  * Geographic Focus: The identification of key neighborhoods like Loop and O'Hare for targeted analysis allows Zuber to better understand and address the specific needs and challenges of these areas, particularly during adverse weather conditions.*

### Project 6: Python

- **Date:* 06/28/2024*  

- **Role:* In my role, I work with a dataset stored in a nested list, where each sublist represents a row and each element corresponds to a column value. I access specific values using single and double indexing, and I can print a row, column, or the entire table. I use these skills to perform calculations and add new columns to the table. *  

- **Tools:* Python*  

- **Summary:* In this Python project, I performed a series of data manipulations and calculations on a dataset stored in a nested list format. The dataset contained information about various gaming consoles. I started by formatting and printing the data in a clean, table-like structure. I then retrieved specific rows and columns from the table using indexing techniques. Additionally, I calculated and added new columns, including the lifespan of each console and the total revenue generated by each console. Finally, I sorted the dataset based on these new metrics to enable easier comparison and analysis *

- **Impact:
  * Data Visualization: By formatting and printing the data in a table-like structure, I made it easier to visually analyze the dataset and identify key insights.
  * Targeted Data Retrieval: I efficiently accessed specific data points, such as the number of units sold for the Game Boy and the details of the Sega CD, facilitating targeted analysis.
  * Enhanced Analysis through New Metrics: By calculating the lifespan and total revenue for each console, I provided valuable metrics that can be used to compare the performance and longevity of different consoles. Sorting the dataset by these metrics further enhanced the ability to draw meaningful conclusions.*
  * Strategic Insights: The analysis and calculations performed in this project enable deeper insights into the gaming console market, such as identifying the most profitable consoles and understanding the impact of product longevity on revenue. These insights can inform future product development and marketing strategies.*

### Project 7: Power BI Final Project

- **Date:* 07/28/2024*  

- **Role:* In this project, I was tasked with solving a real business problem. Guided by a team leader, who outlines the business case, I collaborate with teammates to successfully complete the project. The task is complex and large-scale, so I decide on the research focus and create my own plan. 
The project has two main stages: planning (decomposition) and execution. My responsibilities include developing a detailed plan for the analysis, creating a dashboard, and compiling a report with the findings from my analysis. The final deliverables are the dashboard and the report. *  

- **Tools:* Power BI*  

- **Summary:* The analysis reveals that the customer base is predominantly young adults aged 22-26, with a higher percentage of male and single customers. While students form the largest group, high-income earners are the main contributors to revenue. Preferences are strong for North Indian and Chinese cuisines, as well as popular fast-food brands like Domino’s, Pizza Hut, and KFC. *

* Revenue is largely driven by males, young adults, and single customers, with high-income individuals playing a critical role despite their smaller numbers. However, customer retention has significantly declined from 45.92% in 2018 to 19.02% in 2020, indicating a need for improved retention strategies. *

- **Impact:
  * To maximize revenue, marketing efforts should target the 22-26 age group, single customers, and both genders. Tailored campaigns for these demographics can enhance engagement and spending. Additionally, high-income earners should be offered premium services and exclusive deals to further boost their contribution.
  * Given the strong preference for certain cuisines and brands, expanding offerings and promotions around North Indian, Chinese, and well-loved fast-food chains can drive sales. Collaborating with these brands will also strengthen customer loyalty.
  * Addressing the declining retention rate is crucial. Implementing re-engagement strategies and learning from competitors' successful retention tactics will be key to improving customer loyalty and ensuring long-term revenue growth.*
